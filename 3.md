I’ve drafted a complete, production‑grade blueprint with code, notebooks, pipelines, and diagrams for an Optus‑Sydney‑aligned Azure Databricks project — including HLA, LLD, RAG/LLM, agentic tools, Airflow orchestration, and Azure DevOps CI/CD.

Open the canvas on the right: **“Optus Sydney – Azure Databricks Lakehouse (HLA + LLD + RAG/LLM/Agents + CI/CD + Airflow)”**. It includes:

* High‑level architecture and environment strategy.
* Unity Catalog setup, data contracts, Bronze/Silver/Gold code.
* Streaming joins with watermarks and throughput guidance.
* Airflow DAGs to trigger Databricks Jobs/DLT.
* Azure DevOps CI and CD (multi‑stage) with Bundles.
* Terraform snippets for Azure + Databricks UC.
* RAG ingestion, chunk/embedding, Vector Search index, retrieval & serving.
* Agentic AI tools (SQL tool + retriever) and a minimal orchestrator.
* Testing, observability, SLOs/KPIs, and a runbook.
